    <h1>Entry One</h1>
    <em>
        This is the first entry in the devlog and aims to cover what has 
        happened in developement up until the beginning of this log.

    <p>
        First things first, a diagram of the general game structure has been made
        in <a href="https:\\app.diagrams.net">draw.io</a>. <br>
        The goal of this was simply to conseptualize what functionality 
        was needed for the project and how said functionalities interface 
        should be structured. This diagram is seen in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>
    </p> 
    <figure id="fig1">
        <img src="Pages/images/diagram_entry_one.webp" alt="image of diagram" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>Figure 1: Game interface overview</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The diagram is essentially two parts. The top, showing how the player
        interfaces with the game, and how input actions are consumed and what
        global values go into the consumption of them, and then the 
        bottom part, simply containing class diagrams for the 
        essential classes of the game, with inheritance up to the 
        native godot class they inherit from. And then obviously there is 
        the key to the right, but that's more so just for future readability.

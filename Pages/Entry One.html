    <h1>Entry One</h1>
    <em>
        This is the first entry in the devlog and aims to cover what has 
        happened in developement up until the beginning of this log.
    </em>
    <p>
        First things first, a diagram of the general game structure has been made
        in <a href="https:\\app.diagrams.net">draw.io</a>. <br>
        The goal of this was simply to conseptualize what functionality 
        was needed for the project and how said functionalities interface 
        should be structured. This diagram is seen in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>
    </p> 
    <figure id="fig1">

        <figcaption>Figure 1: Game interface overview</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The diagram is essentially two parts. The top, showing how the player
        interfaces with the game, and how input actions are consumed and what
        global values go into the consumption of them, and then the 
        bottom part, simply containing class diagrams for the 
        essential classes of the game, with inheritance up to the 
        native godot class they inherit from. And then obviously there is 
        the key to the right, but that's more so just for future readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next began testing some of the likely needed technologies in godot 
        and blender. For this a simple throwaway test project was made 
        with some test scenes where technologies could be tried out.<br>
        During this testing we installed the new version of godot (4.4.1) 
        for its improved ik capabilities, that we needed for doing 
        the planned procedural animations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally programming began. The player was implemented as 
        a scene in the game after the structure layed out in 
        <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>, same with the enemy abstract class 
        and most the way with the interactible abstract class. A screenshot 
        showcasing the current state of in-game visuals 
        is seen in <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a> <br>
        Then the main menu screen was made and given a small animation, that will 
        probably see more work in the future. <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows the main menu screen.

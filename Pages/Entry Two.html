    <h1>Entry Two</h1>
    <em>
        This entry will discuss the approach taken for a working 
        hit scan gun and working interactibles using the same 
        essential systems.
    </em>
    <p>
        As was seen in the previous entry, a system for interactibles and 
        shooting was needed. These have been implemented using raycasts 
        from the godot physics engine. The <a href="#fig1">function</a>, 
        shown <a href="#fig1">below</a>, essentially just shoots a raycast 
        at an angle relative to the players position, with a given range, 
        detecting the given layer.
    </p>

            <hr>
    <pre><code id="_shoot_ray">
func _shoot_ray(angle : float, layers : int, range: float, insideFaces : bool ) -> Dictionary:
    var space_state := get_world_3d().direct_space_state
    var direction = position.direction_to(global_position+target_offset).normalized()
    direction = direction.rotated(Vector3.UP, angle)
    var to = position + direction * range
    var parameters : PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D = PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.create(
        position,
        to,
        layers
        )
    parameters.collide_with_areas = true
    parameters.hit_from_inside = insideFaces
    var result : Dictionary = space_state.intersect_ray(parameters)
    return result
    </code></pre>
        </div>

    <p>
        To pick out an example of where this is currently used, in 
        the players interact method, shown <a href="#fig2">below</a>, a ray is shot on layer 1 and 4 
        (the wall and interactible layers). Then it is checked if 
        the ray hit an interactible, if not, that means it hit a wall 
        first or no interactible is in range. If it then hit an 
        interactible the interactibles InteractibleArea (an Area3d with 
        an interact signal), emits its interact signal which the 
        interactible itself will then pick up on, causing it to call its 
        interact method, and emit its own interacted signal.
    </p>
    <figure id="fig2">
        <div class="codecontainer">
            <p>GDScript<button id="_interact_copy" class="codecopy" onclick="copy('_interact', '_interact_copy')">copy</button></p>
            <hr>
    <pre><code id="_interact">
func _interact():
	var hit := _shoot_ray(0,(1&lt;&lt;0) | (1&lt;&lt;3), interaction_range, true)
	if hit.get("collider") is InteractibleArea:
		var collider : InteractibleArea = hit.get("collider")
		collider.emit_signal("interact")
    </code></pre>
        </div>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Example of _shoot_ray usage</figcaption>

    <p>
        Currently nearly the exact same approach as shown <a href="#fig2">above</a> is 
        taken to implement the hit scan bullets from the players attack, the only 
        difference being more rays shot out, as the player can shoot more than one 
        bullet at once, and with some random variety in the angle for spread, and 
        of course different layers to hit enemies and walls only.
